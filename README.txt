FOR MY CODE TO RUN SUCCESSFULLY YOU NEED BELOW PACKAGES IN YOUR ENVIRONMENT

numpy==1.20.0\
tensorflow==2.8.0\
ipywidgets==7.6.5\
Pillow==8.2.0\

My model has been trained on FER2013 dataset. Below are the instruction for my project:
1. I have stored two .ipynb files, VAE_01.ipynb displays the only GUI output calling the saved trained models from the folder
2. The second file VAE_02.ipynb displays the code for training both the models and GUI output.
3. I have stored both the models in the folder VAE.
4. For you to check my GUI you can restart and run the VAE_01.ipynb file it will take less than 10s to run all the cell.
5. Rerun Cell 3 in VAE_01.ipynb file if it shows any error while interacting with the GUI, Once rerun it will work perfectly.
6. For Task two upload a image from dataset and you can immediately interact with the images  reconstructed images from both the models
